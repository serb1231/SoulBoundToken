# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Testing the contract

```
npm test
```

## Deploying the contract

You can target any network from your Hardhat config using:

```
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/MyToken.ts --network <network-name>
```

## Running a local blockchain to test functionalities
In one terminal, one should run:
```
npx hardhat node
```
And in another terminal, they should first deploy the contract:
```
npx hardhat ignition deploy .\ignition\modules\DeployEverything.ts --network localhost
```
And then run the tests, one at a time, using the syntax:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/<\testAaaBbb>.ts --network localhost
```
After each test, one should better restart the blockchain, in order to delete the history. Otherwise, the future tests will fail, or not display the wonderful "GOOD".
